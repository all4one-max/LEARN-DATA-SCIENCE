SO IN THE SUMMER OF 2020 I TOOK A COURSE OF DATA SCIENCE AND ML FROM CODING NINJAS.

AS A PART OF THE COURSE I LEARNT GIT, WHICH USED TO BE QUITE OVERWHELMING EARLIER. BUT NOW IT SEEMS FUN.

SO I DECIDED TO MAKE A REPOSITORY OF ALL THE THINGS I LEARNT (BASICALLY ALL THE CODES I WROTE AND SOME NOTES I GOT).

NOW, AS A PART OF COURSE I DID LIKE 10-15 PROJECTS WHICH TOOK A HELL LOT A TIME. I COULD HAVE COMMITED IN REPO, BUT THEN IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL
SINCE I SCORED 100% IN ALL OF THEM. THEREFORE, I MADE SURE TO REMOVE ALL THE PROJECT FILES. ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE PROBLEMS SOLVED,
FEEL FREE TO MAIL ME, I WILL GIVE SOME CHALLENGING TASK AND EVEN BETTER IF YOU ARE ABLE TO SOLVE THE TASK I MERGE YOUR BRANCH AND IN DOING SO 
I WILL LEARN HOW TO USE PULL REQUEST. WIN WIN HUH:)

HAPPY CODING :)
